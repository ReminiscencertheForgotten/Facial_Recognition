# Facial_Recognition
Python Homework,2021

> The homework is a version of facial recognition, which could be used to be trained to recognize the gender of the photos in dataset.

## About the code structure

**The code here belongs to 2 parts.**

Part 1 is responsible to **train, test and save the model**, while the Part 2 is used to **test a single photo and provide the result with GUI**.

The main file of Part 1 is **main.py**, and for the Part 2 it is **Terminal.py**.For other files, they're used to provide functions for the formers.

You can run each of them to get your results.

## About the directories

You are able to notice that there are directories such as **Datafile, TrainResult, and images**.

### Datafile

The directory is used to save the processed data, with the big dataset(about 240M) not be uploaded as a regret.

So if you are going to run the code, I will provide you with the dataset.

As you can see, the processed data is saved as .csv files. While running the code yourself, it will be OK to check the **main.py** to change the filenames you want.

### Train Result

The directory is used to save the trained model, as .pth files. You can check the **main.py** to change the filenames you want.

### Images

The directory is used to save the icons and the images of the final GUI, so do not **delete it casually**.

## Besides

One of the files is not successfully uploaded because of the restriction. You are required to **compile the images.qrc yourself**.

It's very convenient to make it with the help of the VScode.
